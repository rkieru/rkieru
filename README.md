Hi, I'm Rob!

I like to design things!  I'm exceptionally well-versed in HTML and CSS, know enough JavaScript to be both an asset and a danger, 
and still like developing projects in PHP even if it isn't en vogue (PHP is a good programming language, Brent). Things I like to tackle on a daily basis:

- Improving User Experience (improving user interaction, ensuring accesibility, etc.)
- Finding the sweet spot between "This is functional" and "This is beautiful"
- Banging my head against a wall after 2 hours of troubleshooting a coding error only to find its a mistyped semicolon or a single quote where it should be double.

When I'm not working myself to the bone to meet and exceed client expectations I can usually be found haunting the back alleys of StackOverflow's 
`css` and `bootstrap` tags.
